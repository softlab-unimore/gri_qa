Let's think step-by-step.

to determine which company has the highest total emissions of ghg generated in 2022, we need to calculate the total emissions for both companies listed in the tables.

1. **otc_bayzf**:
   - scope 1 (direct emissions): 1.91 million metric tons
   - scope 2 (indirect emissions): 1.12 million metric tons
   - scope 3 (indirect emissions): 9.72 million metric tons
   - total emissions = scope 1 + scope 2 + scope 3 = 1.91 + 1.12 + 9.72 = 12.75 million metric tons

2. **otc_esocf**:
   - scope 1 (direct emissions): 53.07 million metric tons
   - scope 2 (indirect emissions - market based): 5.10 million metric tons
   - scope 3 (indirect emissions): 71.04 million metric tons
   - total emissions = scope 1 + scope 2 + scope 3 = 53.07 + 5.10 + 71.04 = 129.21 million metric tons

now, we compare the total emissions of both companies:
- otc_bayzf: 12.75 million metric tons
- otc_esocf: 129.21 million metric tons

clearly, otc_esocf has the highest total emissions.

final answer: otc_esocf
