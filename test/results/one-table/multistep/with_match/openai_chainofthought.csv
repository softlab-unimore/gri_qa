1. grid electricity
2. purchased renewable electricity
3. self-generated renewable electricity
4. district heating
5. fuel oil
6. gas
7. coal
8. renewable fuel and heat

next, we will extract the values for each of these sources for the years 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 

here are the values from the table:

- grid electricity: 
  - 2023: 82590
  - 2022: 108263
  - 2021: 132771
  - 2020: 148969

- purchased renewable electricity: 
  - 2023: 610614
  - 2022: 588851
  - 2021: 612752
  - 2020: 585495

- self-generated renewable electricity:

  - 2023: 593
  - 2022: 1073
  - 2021: 1231
  - 2020: 1155

now, we will calculate the total energy consumption for each year and then sum these totals.
