Let's think step-by-step.

to find the top 2 lowest water consumption values obtained by summing the 2023 and 2022 consumption for the companies otc_bamgf and otc_esocf, we first need to extract the relevant water consumption data from the provided tables.

from table 0 (otc_bamgf):
- 2022 consumption: 4840161.0 m3
- 2023 consumption: 5049144.0 m3

calculating the total for otc_bamgf:
total = 2022 + 2023 = 4840161.0 + 5049144.0 = 9889305.0 m3

from table 1 (otc_esocf):
- 2022 consumption: 45.20 million m3
- 2023 consumption: 35.4 million m3

calculating the total for otc_esocf:
total = 2022 + 2023 = 45.20 + 35.4 = 80.60 million m3

now we have the total water consumption values for both companies:
- otc_bamgf: 9889305.0 m3 (or 9889.31 million m3)
- otc_esocf: 80.60 million m3

next, we need to convert the total for otc_bamgf into millions of m3 for consistency:
9889305.0 m3 = 9889.31 million m3

now we can list the total consumption values in millions of m3:
- otc_bamgf: 9889.31 million m3
- otc_esocf: 80.60 million m3

to find the top 2 lowest values in ascending order:
1. 80.60 million m3 (otc_esocf)
2. 9889.31 million m3 (otc_bamgf)

thus, the top 2 lowest water consumption values in ascending order are:
80.60, 9889.31

final answer: 80.60, 9889.31
