1. **identify the values for grid electricity scope 2 emissions:**
   - for 2022: 49674 tco₂e
   - for 2021: 66692 tco₂e

2. **calculate the percentage ratio for grid electricity:**
   - the percentage ratio can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{percentage ratio (grid)} = \left( \frac{\text{2022 value} - \text{2021 value}}{\text{2021 value}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{percentage ratio (grid)} = \left( \frac{49674 - 66692}{66692} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{-17018}{66692} \right) \times 100 \approx -25.52\%
     \]

3. **identify the values for renewable electricity scope 2 emissions:**
   - for 2022: 703 tco₂e
   - for 2021: 701 tco₂e

4. **calculate the percentage ratio for renewable electricity:**
   - using the same formula:
     \[
     \text{percentage ratio (renewable)} = \left( \frac{703 - 701}{701} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{701} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.29\%
     \]

5. **calculate the average of the two percentage ratios:**
   - the average can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{average} = \frac{\text{percentage ratio (grid)} + \text{percentage ratio (renewable)}}{2}
     \]
   - plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{average} = \frac{-25.52 + 0.29}{2} \"
