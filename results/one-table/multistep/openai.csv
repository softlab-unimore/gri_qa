Total indirect consumption of energy for 2021 (Group Total) is 692 TJ and for 2021 (Full consolidated) is 366 TJ.  

Calculating the sums:  
Direct consumption sum = 14171 + 13325 = 27496 TJ  
Indirect consumption sum = 692 + 366 = 1058 TJ  

Now, calculating the averages:  
Average direct consumption = 27496 / 2 = 13748.00 TJ  
Average indirect consumption = 1058 / 2 = 529.00 TJ  

Final average of the sums = (13748.00 + 529.00) / 2 = 7138.50 TJ
