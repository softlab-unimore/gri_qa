7,What is the average amount of GHG emissions Scope 3 in 2023 among the following companies in Million metric tons of CO2 equivalents?,22.92, 22.92
8,What is the average amount of GHG emissions Scope 2 in 2023 among the following companies in million mt CO2e?,0.07,"to find the average amount of ghg emissions scope 2 in 2023 among the companies listed, we need to extract the scope 2 emissions data for each company from the provided tables.

1. **nasdaq_dasty**: the scope 2 emissions in 2023 are reported as 3193 tco2e. to convert this to million mt co2e, we divide by 1,000,000:
   - 3193 tco2e = 0.003193 million mt co2e.

2. **otc_rwnef**: the scope 2 emissions (location based) in 2023 are reported as 0.2 million mt co2e.

3. **munich-re**: the scope 2 emissions in 2023 are reported as 14249 tco2e. to convert this to million mt co2e, we divide by 1,000,000:
   - 14249 tco2e = 0.014249 million mt co2e.

now we have the scope 2 emissions for each company in million mt co2e:
- nasdaq_dasty: 0.003193
- otc_rwnef: 0.2
- munich-re: 0.014249

next, we calculate the average of these values:
average = (0.003193 + 0.2 + 0.014249) / 3

calculating the sum:
0.003193 + 0.2 + 0.014249 = "
