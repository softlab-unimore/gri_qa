1. **extract scope 1 emissions data**:
   - from the first company (otc_adddf), the scope 1 emissions in 2023 are 21779.0 tons co2e.
   - from the second company (otc_rwnef), the scope 1 emissions in 2023 are 61.9 million mt co2e.

2. **convert units**:
   - the emissions for otc_adddf are given in tons, so we need to convert this to million mt co2e:
     - 21779.0 tons co2e = 21.779 million mt co2e (since 1 million mt = 1,000,000 tons).
