carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2023;2017: 327 kilotons (kt) net carbon emissions;2023: 0 kilotons (kt) net carbon emissions;Net carbon emissions = gross carbon emissions (scope 1, 2, and selected scope 3) minus purchased renewable energy certificates (EACs), self-generated renewable energy, and carbon offsets. To track progress on our target, we derived annual targets for our internal operational steering. Since the beginning of 2020, these annual targets have been integrated in the Executive Board’s short-term performance-based compensation. Status: Achieved
1.5°C-aligned science-based target (SBT);2023: 6.9 million tons gross carbon emissions (market-based);2030: reduction by 90% (near-term and long-term target);Acceleration of SAP’s science-based target (to reach net zero across our value chain in line with a 1.5°C future by 2030, 20 years earlier than originally planned) required a reassessment of the baseline, underlying scopes, calculation methodologies, and the target pathway. Status and next steps: o In 2023, our original SBT was replaced by our commitment to reach net zero by 2030 in line with the SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard. o In line with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, we revised the baseline, which includes scope 1, scope 2 market-based, and all business-relevant scope 3 value chain emissions. For more information, see the Non-Financial Notes section. o Next steps: submission to the SBTi in 2024 and publication of target pathway 2024—2030 in the SAP Integrated Report 2024."
