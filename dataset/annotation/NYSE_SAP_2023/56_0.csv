"SAP’s sustainability software portfolio;e SAP delivers sustainability management solutions for sustainability reporting, climate action, circular economy, and social responsibility to enable our customers to run sustainable and resilient operations as described in the Product Strategy section.” « Asco-innovation customers for the Sustainability Control Tower, Sustainability Footprint Management, Sustainability Data Exchange, and Green Ledger, various teams such as the Corporate Sustainability team and Sustainability Controlling team provide input and feedback to the development teams with the aim of leveraging a solution that enables companies to record, report, and act on their sustainability goals.
Carbon-neutral cloud — solutions and Pao eetes emissions;The vast majority of our overall carbon emissions result from the use of our software. To address this, we aim to help our customers, hardware providers, and others to run more energy-efficient operations.
;* By powering all data centers with 100% renewable electricity, we offer our customers carbon-neutral® cloud software solutions and help them reduce their overall carbon emissions (upstream scope 3).
;e We started to develop a carbon footprint sizing approach with the aim of enabling our customers to gain transparency on the carbon impact of their SAP applications that run in SAP’s internal and external data centers, answering the question of how much our customers can reduce their environmental footprint while running SAP solutions on SAP’s self-operated or on SAP sourced infrastructure.
;« We collaborate with customers to optimize their on-premise landscapes so that they consume less energy (for example, we decommission legacy systems, archive unused data, consolidate business applications, and virtualize their system landscapes).
Supply Chain;
Environmentally conscious procurement);« Multi-phased supply chain engagement program: We partner with (top) suppliers to procure low carbon and energy-efficient products and services to reduce their environmental footprint throughout the supply chain. « We consider environmental requirements in procurement processes and decisions. For more see the Sustainable Procurement section.

Fostering biodiversity and nature-based solutions to climate change;« Intact forests help to slow climate change, safeguard biodiversity, and provide critical ecosystem services to people. Thus, reforestation projects of SAP’s climate action plan.
;part « Since 2012, SAP has helped to plant over 16.3 million trees to support ecosystem restoration and sustainable development. SAP will continue to finance nature-based solutions and is committed to planting 21 million trees by the end of 2025.
;e By applying strict quality criteria, SAP aims to support initiatives which restore and protect the right trees in the right places and have a positive impact on the local community, biodiversity, and climate.
;e Since 2021, SAP has been part of the 1t.org Corporate Alliance, which mobilizes business leaders to responsibly conserve, restore, and grow trees worldwide while pursuing the 1.5 degrees Celsius science-based target.

;Running SAP facilities with 100% renewable electricity;Since 2014, SAP has been running all its offices and data centers” with 100% renewable electricity in alignment with our commitment toward the RE100 initiative. For this, we use two strategic levers:
;¢ We invest in high-quality, ekoenergy-certified EACs to foster renewable energy generation.
;e We produce renewable electricity in selected SAP locations worldwide through solar panels (such as in Palo Alto, CA, in the United States, Bangalore, India, and Mougins, France). At SAP’s headquarters, we are in the process of implementing an on-site Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) solar project with the aim of increasing the share of renewable electricity self-produced on-site and achieving price stability.
;e As a potential third lever, we are running a green tariff pilot in Australia to power our local facilities with renewable electricity (bundled EACs).
;This approach allows us to reduce our entire electricity-consumption-related emissions (2023: 256 kt in total; 161 kt by SAP and 95 kt by suppliers; 2022: 257 kt). Going forward, we aim to expand the usage of Power Purchase Agreements for sourcing renewable electricity.
ISO 14001;SAP's environmental management system (EMS) is implemented in over 45 sites in 26 countries worldwide and certified by the internationally recognized ISO 14001:2015 standard. In 2023, we successfully maintained this certification.
;e Target: Increase EMS scope to 100% of SAP’s major company-owned sites by 2025 (2023: 86%)."
