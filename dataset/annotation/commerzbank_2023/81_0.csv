osure of the organisation’s governance with regard to nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities;Commerzbank has adopted a holistic approach to sustainability governance (see “TCFD recommendations in the non-financial report”) that also takes into account nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. This governance is supplemented by an external advisory board that provides valuable input on the topic of biodiversity, among other things.;© Anchoring sustainability in our strategy: Governance structure consolidated

osure of nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities on the organisation’s business model, strategy and financial planning, where such information is material;In order to reduce our impact on nature, we have been integrating appropriate exclusion criteria into our core business for many years. We also classify the nature-related application of funds in the ESG framework as sustainable financing with a view to supporting corresponding lending opportunities. The protection of biodiversity therefore plays a crucial role achieving our goal of mobilising €300bn for sustainable financial products. As part of a new risk and impact analysis, expanded to include an initial scenario analysis, we have determined the key sectors in the loan portfolio with nature-related risks and impacts. The main drivers of risks and negative impacts have also been identified. The protection of biodiversity is likewise taken into account in our own banking operations as part of the integrated environmental and energy management system and with respect to measures aimed at optimising the consumption of resources.;© Anchoring sustainability in our strategy: Key issues analysed

ription process by the organisation to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities;As part of a new materiality analysis in 2022, the topic of diversity was identified as material and incorporated into the annual Bank-wide strategy process. The topic is therefore increasingly being pursued at a strategic level and shifting into the focus of sustainability management. The analysis of nature-related risks and impacts incorporated two TNFD scenario narratives and was carried out using the “ENCORE” tool. On the basis of the results, we identified potential areas of action and strategic priorities and will develop further analyses and measures to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity has additionally been classified as essential for our own banking operations and is taken into account accordingly.;© Responsible management: Making our stance clear
