"[RISK DIMENSION Technology;Transitory climate risks;Innovations in sustainable technologies are fostered, accelerating the prevalence of electromobility. For the BMW Group, this may have a negative impact on deliveries and the residual value of existing products. In the areas of Production and Purchasing, remanence costs and impairment risks may result from changing processes and equipment. The digital connectivity between companies and products to support decarbonisation is increasing in order to streamline processes and better manage emissions. Risks for the BMW Group result from the time delay until such technologies can be used if, for example, some areas of the supply chain cannot provide the relevant standards and interfaces quickly enough. Significant technological innovations may make product and production technologies, which are in use or in the pipeline today (from energy storage to recycling), as well as investments in these innovations, obsolete or challenge their efficiency. In terms of infrastructure (such as new fuel options, charging technologies for electric vehicles), they may jeopardise the availability and acceptance of planned or expected conditions for the customer. ;Market and competition;Due to a global focus on sustainable products, energy prices and commodities costs are rising. This has a direct impact on manufacturing costs for the BMW Group and may go on to affect deliveries. Furthermore, credit and residual value risks in the Financial Services segment may also be impacted. Existing and new competitors are accelerating the production of electrified vehicles. If products and business models are perceived as being more attractive by customers, this may have the corresponding impact on deliveries by the BMW Group. Any serious failure to comply with sustainability or quality standards and providing incorrect information accordingly, could cause disruptions in the supply chain or a shortfall of individual suppliers to deliver. ;Capital and financial market;A good ranking in the ESG ratings has a positive effect on the perception of a company on the capital market and has a favourable effect on investment decisions. Investment and financing decisions by investors or lenders depend on a good ESG rating. Short-term and unforeseeable regulatory changes may reduce the appeal of a company on the capital market and increase refinancing costs if it is not possible to react to the changes in the regulatory framework in time. This may impact the credit rating and refinancing costs of the BMW Group. The short-notice termination of government subsidies to promote low-carbon mobility may reduce the demand for electrified vehicles. Uneven adjustments of prices for carbon emissions could have a negative impact on the macro- and microeconomic situation of a national economy, causing distortions in the credit risk, for example. ;Politics, legal affairs and regulatory framework;Any short-notice tightening of legislation or regulations in the BMW Group's main markets (EU, US, China) may exceed the speed at which BMW Group and its suppliers can respond and poss risks in terms of delivery volume, costs and residual values. Production processes must quickly be changed to green energy sources and resource-friendly facilities. The BMW Group already consistently implements known requirements. However, additional costs may result if additional requirements are announced at short notice. For suppliers, stricter requirements regarding circular economy, recycling and avoiding the use of resources may lead to higher costs in the short term. Fast rising and/or selectively discriminating regional vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes may lead to higher costs or a decrease in deliveries.;society;around the world, people’s environmental awareness is increasing. social discussions arising from a perceived worsening of the climate’s health may lead to changes in mobility patterns and/or customer preferences that may vary by region. this may require us to adapt the product portfolio, which may impact deliveries and residual values for vehicles.]"
