Labour practices;(1) Number of work stoppages and (2) total days idle;Quantitative;Number, days idle;TR-AU-310a.2;(1) The BMW Group provides the number of work stoppages (strikes and lockouts) affecting more than 1,000 employees and that lasted one full shift or longer. The number of work stoppages for 2023 was zero. (2) The BMW Group provides the total number of days idle resulting from work stoppages as per the definition in (1). The total number of days idle can be calculated from the total number of employees involved with each work stoppage and the number of days the work stoppage lasted. The number of days idle for 2023 was zero. Strike action is usually taken to reinforce pay rise demands.

Fuel economy and use-phase emissions;Discussion of strategy for managing fleet fuel economy and emissions risks and opportunities;Discussion and analysis;N/A;TR-AU-410a.3;In line with its corporate strategy, the BMW Group is pursuing a clear course of decarbonisation. Against a backdrop of increasing electrification, it is particularly important to consider carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of a vehicle. In this context, the BMW Group has set itself decarbonisation targets by 2030 (base year 2019) during the use phase, in the upstream supply chain and in production. These have been registered with the SBTi and validated. The BMW Group is also taking measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It is therefore imperative to identify climate-related risks and opportunities and to take appropriate account of them in determining the strategic direction to be followed, managing the business and organising a group-wide risk management system. For further information, see climate-related risks and opportunities. The BMW Group is also working consistently to reduce vehicle pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM)."
