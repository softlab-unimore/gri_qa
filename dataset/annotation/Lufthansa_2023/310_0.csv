;12.8;Customer concerns/Product and services;In designing its range of products and services, the Lufthansa Group has also taken sustainability issues into account to meet the growing demand for more sustainable products. This includes offers designed to compensate or reduce the carbon emissions caused by flights, waste avoidance and a continuously expanding selection of intermodal travel options.;p.95F.

; ; ;Lufthansa Group also defines its own expanded emission reduction targets. As befits its pioneering role in climate protection, the Lufthansa Group has defined its own carbon reduction targets which demonstrate an extra level of ambition. The Lufthansa Group's carbon emissions reduction target was successfully validated by the SBTi in the summer of 2022. The SBTi, a joint initiative of CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), develops sector-specific criteria for climate protection, applies these criteria to participating companies and validates the corresponding corporate targets. With its SBTi validation, the Lufthansa Group became the first airline group in Europe with a scientifically profound CO₂ reduction target in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement of 2015. Lufthansa Group is among the first three airlines worldwide to have their reduction targets validated by the SBTi. Specifically and in accordance with the SBTi guidance, the Lufthansa Group has committed to reducing its carbon intensity, i.e. its carbon emissions per transported tonne-kilometre (passenger and cargo), by 30.6% in the period from 2019 to 2030. This target may only be achieved by reducing fuel consumption or by substituting fossil fuel with SAF. Over and above the reduction required by the SBTi targets, the Group aims to achieve its self-imposed target of cutting net carbon emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2019 by means of voluntary offsets. The Lufthansa Group aims to be carbon neutral in 2050.;p.81
; ; ;Specific CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometre drop to new best value for the Lufthansa Group. The absolute CO₂ emissions resulting from the combustion of kerosene by Lufthansa Group aircraft in 2023 increased by 16% to 26.8 million tonnes (previous year: 23.1 million tonnes) due to the rise in demand and the expanded flight capacity. CO₂ emissions per transported tonne-kilometre declined by 2.8 grammes to 833.9 grammes (previous year: 836.7 grammes). Specific CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometre were 1.8% lower than in the previous year at 88.4 grammes (previous year: 90.0 grammes). No distinction is made in these disclosures between fossil and biogenic CO₂ emissions.; 
; ; ;The Lufthansa Group improved its performance by 2.7% in 2023 compared with 2019 in terms of the core KPI of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (measured in grammes of CO₂ per revenue tonne-kilometre).;"
