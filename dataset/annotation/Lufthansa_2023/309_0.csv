SDG 10 ze, WeQUALes a~ &lt;=&gt; v;10.2;Employee concerns/Diversity and equal opportunities;New projects and initiatives are aimed at increasing the proportion of women with management responsibility: Within the Executive Board project Female Leadership Boost launched in 2021, the Lufthansa Group has set itself the task of establishing the topic of gender diversity in its leadership culture on a lasting basis. The project comprises a broad portfolio of individual development measures for talented women, in addition to a fixed percentage of women on shortlists for management positions, including special programmes for junior managers and networks for them to share their experiences. In November 2023, the eight-month programme NextUp Women was introduced to help women take their next career step towards a management position and provide assistance through a series of modules building upon one another, in which they explore topics such as leadership and carry out a strengths and weaknesses analysis.;&gt; p.103F.
;10.2;The proportion of women at management levels increased slightly in 2023. Overall, the proportion of women in management roles in the Lufthansa Group at the end of 2023 was 22.3%, compared with 20.4% in the previous year. In line with the German Act on Equal Participation of Men and Women in Executive Positions in the Public and Private Sectors (FPoG), women accounted for 9.7% of positions at the first management level and 17.8% at the second management level at Deutsche Lufthansa AG on 31 December 2023. By comparison, they represented 9.4% at the first management level and 15.4% at the second management level at the end of 2022.;&gt; p.104

;10.2;Focus on diversity as a culture-promoting measure: in 2023, the Lufthansa Group launched a cultural programme, Lufthansa Group Cultural Journey powered by Diversity. This is intended to help strengthen the cultural coherence of the individual airlines, businesses and segments. To facilitate communication for both German-speaking and non-German-speaking employees, the Lufthansa Group has been offering the opportunity to learn twelve languages via a digital learning platform since 2023. In addition, all job descriptions and contracts have also been published or made available in English since 2023. To make further progress in internationalising the Group, target ratios have been specified for its talent and trainee programmes to ensure a certain proportion of participants from countries outside the Group’s home markets. The targets of 30% for trainee programmes and 10% for internal talent programmes were already achieved in 2023. The Globalists talent programme introduced in 2023 is designed to identity foreign above-average performers interested in a rotation to the Group’s home markets (DACHB). In the reporting year alone, this programme enabled 72 global talented individuals to forge ahead in their careers.;&gt; p.103
