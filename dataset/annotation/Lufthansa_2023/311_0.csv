13.1;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;The Lufthansa Group aims to achieve carbon-neutral mobility in its ground processes by 2030 with electromobility or the use of other emission-free vehicles. For this purpose, the smaller locations of Berlin, Dusseldorf, Cologne and Stuttgart were included alongside the Group's major sites in 2023. A total of 26 electric apron vehicles were purchased for these smaller locations. This brings the total number of electric vehicles at these locations to 46 in 2023, which is equivalent to around 4% of these locations’ total operational vehicle fleet. In 2023, the number of all-electric company cars in the Lufthansa Group's fleet rose from 374 vehicles in the previous year (of which 255 in Germany) to 554. They thus account for a share of 36%.;&gt; p.87
13.1;Employee concerns/ Attractiveness as an employer;The Lufthansa Group has expanded its company car electromobility offering for employees by providing financial support for electric vehicles. More than 50% of newly ordered company cars were fully electric in the reporting year thanks to this measure. In addition, 104 charging stations for electric vehicles were installed in the employee car park at the Lufthansa Aviation Center in Frankfurt in 2023. Overall, there are 212 such charging stations in Germany. As well as the contribution to the “job ticket” for use of public transport, which the Group’s employees have been offered for many years now, the Lufthansa Group has been enabling its employees in Germany to lease bicycles again since 2023. Around 60,000 employees are thus able to lease a bicycle on favourable conditions and around 4,000 lease agreements were concluded in 2023.;&gt; p.100F.
