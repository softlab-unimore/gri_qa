;45;Employee concerns/ Transformation capabilities;Multiple changes call for long-term transformation process and continuous transformation support: Employees are offered regular professional training courses in order to continuously update their skills and abilities. In 2022, a department was established with the task of conducting a structured evaluation of the impacts on future roles and competence profiles of employees in all professional groups and to accompany them through changes. In the reporting year, this approach was applied to the administrative employees of Deutsche Lufthansa AG for the first time. The findings will be recorded in 2024, together with those from the participating departments, and measures will be identified on this basis. In this context, the Lufthansa Group has established a supportive process that enables employees to analyse the future viability of their own skill sets and to compare them with the current and future requirements for their roles. This is combined with wide-ranging opportunities for self-directed learning. Besides the traditional Group-wide training portfolio offered by the Lufthansa Group Campus, all employees in the Lufthansa Group have access to over 12,000 digital video courses in German and English, enabling self-directed learning.;&gt; p.104F.
AFORDARLEANO CLEAN EERE vie 30: rss;7.2;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;In the past decade, the Lufthansa Group has paid close attention to research into SAF (i.e. synthetic kerosene produced from renewable energy sources) and its testing and use. Since this time, the Lufthansa Group has worked in partnerships to drive key technologies for SAF production. Through letters of intent the Lufthansa Group secures access to required SAF volumes.;&gt; p.80
;7.2;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;Sustainable aviation fuel to be used more widely: SAF sales are set to be increased via the continuous development of more sustainable products, which customers can use throughout the travel chain, e.g. during the booking process or in-flight.;&gt; p.82
;7.2;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;To enable the continuous procurement of SAF on the spot market, up to USD 250 million has been released for the period up to 2026 by the Executive Board of Deutsche Lufthansa AG. In addition, options for long-term supply commitments around the world are under consideration. These are expected to offer considerable production volumes and security of supply from around 2025 onwards. In 2023, two further letters of intent were signed in order to secure a permanent supply of sustainable aviation fuels for the Lufthansa Group. In the long term, the Lufthansa Group will provide support for innovative supply concepts with the goal of transforming today's start-ups and developers into tomorrow's suppliers. In this regard, the Lufthansa Group focuses on synthetic kerosene based on residual materials, ligneous biomass and renewable electrical energy (power-to-liquid - PtL) as well as on research into the direct use of sunlight for fuel synthesis. To accelerate the market introduction of particularly forward-looking sustainable aviation fuels, the Lufthansa Group intends to establish an SAF Buyers Alliance next year. This is intended to pool demand on the part of multiple corporate customers, to enable the construction of pilot systems for fuel generation.;&gt; p.82
;7.2;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;In 2023, Lufthansa German Airlines signed a letter of intent for a research partnership with the German Aerospace Center, Munich Airport, Airbus and MTU for operational testing of every aspect of PtL use in daily flight operations. This includes a wide range of questions relating to the use of SAF, such as the use of pure (100%) PtL fuel and the effect of SAF on the formation of contrails.;&gt; p.83
;7.2;Environmental concerns/ Climate protection;At the political level, the Lufthansa Group supports a global strategy for the supply of sustainable aviation fuels, such as through its membership of the ICAO Fuel Task Group since 2023. At the level of the EU, the Lufthansa Group advocates a simplification of the compliance processes for SAF-related regulation and has prepared a position paper on a book and claim system. This involves trading SAF on the basis of certificates rather than physically.;&gt; p.83"
