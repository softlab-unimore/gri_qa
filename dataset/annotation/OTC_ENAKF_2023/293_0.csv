(1) number of customers served in markets subject to renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and (2) percentage fulfillment of RPS target by market;Quantitative;IF-EU-110a.4;Data are not available. RPS mechanisms are commonly used in the United States. As E.ON operates in European countries, where the standards are not widely adopted, it is not applicable for E.ON. E.ON supplies more than 50 percent of its customers with green electricity products.
Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) NOx (excluding N2O), (2) SOx, (3) particulate matter (PM10), (4) lead (Pb), and (5) mercury (Hg); percentage of each in or near areas of dense population;Quantitative;IF-EU-120a.1;NOx emissions: 2,501 metric tons; SO2 emissions: 828 metric tons; Dust emissions: 53 metric tons. Fossil-fueled power plants emit nitric oxide (""NOx""), sulfur dioxide (""SO2""), and dust. This type of power generation is no longer a core E.ON business. We therefore no longer consider it a key indicator. We now focus on small-scale, embedded generation units. Our NOx, SO2, and dust emissions are mostly attributable to small-scale gas-fired combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants and larger district heat networks. Data on lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and the percentage of each indicator in or near areas of dense population are not available as they are not relevant for E.ON."
