Greenhouse Gas Emissions;Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations;RT-CH-110a.1;NFR, pp. 110-112 The calculation of Scope 1 emissions includes all greenhouse gases that result from the consumption of the corresponding energy sources, i.e. CO2, CH4, N2O. The share of CH4 and N2O in the total emissions is approximately 1%. At Brenntag, none of the emissions are covered under emissions-limiting regulations.
