2. c) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);Several scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019, which included critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and resource availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways and technology developments, among others, with consequences quantified, looking at ten regions and a number of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider operates.
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);In 2022, Schneider Electric published a set of scenarios exploring the feasibility of a 1.5°C trajectory in a report called “Back to 2050”, demonstrating that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with IPCC’s 1.5°C scenarios, is still possible, and the Group is uniquely positioned to embark its ecosystem onto an inclusive, zero-carbon transition.
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);Key findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the ones from the IEA, BNEF, the IRENA, among others.
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);Governance is well in place, under the leadership of the Chief Sustainability, Customer Satisfaction &amp; Quality Officer, and both short- and long-term analyses are shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across business and operations.
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);As part of the analysis, the Group identified that a growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and services creates a strong business opportunity for Schneider Electric. Key takeaways from the analysis is the dominant role of:
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);* Electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with demand growing potentially up to 3x by 2050; * Digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic productivity, notably around efficiency in energy and resource use and circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.
;CDP - C3.2, C3.2a URD — Chapter 2 (2.3);All these findings, and their potential financial impact on its business, have helped the Group to fine-tune key development areas that will allow its active contribution to the low-carbon transition, enabling notably the development of its sustainability portfolio of offers.

3. a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying;CDP -C2.1, C2.1a, C2.1b, C2.2, C2.2a URD— Chapter 2 (2.1, 2.3);Environment and climate-related risks are included in Schneider’s Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk taxonomy (more details in section 2.3.1.1 on page 156). In addition to the risk identification processes described above, risks are"
