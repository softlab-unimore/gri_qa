Primary drivers and actions;* Gradual phase out of coal-fired capacity in 2024-2026, with planned closure of the Federico II and Torrevaldaliga Nord plants in Italy (with a total capacity of about 3.6 GW). + Invest €12.1 billion to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 13.4 GW of new renewables capacity (about 11.3 GW of which at the consolidated level) in 2024-2026, reaching 73 GW of renewables capacity (including BESS) by 2026.;« Continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with Group investments raising the proportion of renewables plants in the asset portfolio to about 85% in 2030, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 90% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation. + Exit from coal-fired generation, which is expected to take place by 2027 globally. » No use of carbon-removal technologies;Exit from the thermal electricity generation business, achieving a 100% renewable energy mix. + No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target."
