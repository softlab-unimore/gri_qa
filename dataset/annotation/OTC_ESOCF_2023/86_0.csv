Primary drivers and actions;Increase the percentage of renewable energy sold to customers, while increasing the Group's renewables production and optimizing customer portfolio, continuing supply and demand balancing strategy.;Continue the strategy of balancing supply and demand and increase the share of electricity sold at a fixed price covered by carbon-free generation.;By 2040, achieve 100% of electricity sales covered by renewables.
;In Europe, increase the share of fixed-price energy sales to end users covered by zero-emissions sources from about 65% in 2023 to more than 80% in 2026;Continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, increasing zero-emissions generation to about 90% of the total in 2030. ;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.
;In Latin America, maintain 100% zero-emissions sales to end users (including through PPAs).;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.;
;In North America, maintain 100% zero-emissions sales to end users.;;
;Continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, increasing zero-emissions generation from 75% in 2023 (including managed capacity) to 86% of total in 2026 including consolidated and managed capacity;;
;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.;;
Results and main actions in 2023;KPI achievement in 2023: 168 gCO2eq/kWh;;
;13% increase in Group consolidated renewables generation in 2023 on 2022;;
;7% reduction in 2023 compared with 2022 in the gap between sale of electricity to end users and own generation in the countries in which the Group has an integrated position.;;
