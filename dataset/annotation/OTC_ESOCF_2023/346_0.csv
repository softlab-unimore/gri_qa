Primary drivers and actions;;;
; • Gradual phase out of coal-fired capacity in 2024-2026, with planned closure of the Federico II and Torrevaldaliga Nord plants in Italy (with a total capacity of about 3.6 GW). ;Continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with Group investments raising the proportion of renewables plants in the asset portfolio to about 85% in 2030, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 90% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation.;• Exit from the thermal electricity generation business, achieving a 100% renewable energy mix. 
;• Invest €12.1 billion to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 13.4 GW of new renewables capacity (about 11.3 GW of which at the consolidated level) in 2024-2026, reaching 73 GW of renewables capacity (including BESS) by 2026. ;• Exit from coal-fired generation, which is expected to take place by 2027 globally.;• No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.
;• Continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with the proportion of renewables plants in the Enel asset portfolio reaching 78% in 2026, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 86% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation. ;• No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.;

Results and main actions in 2023; KPI achievement in 2023: 160 gCO2eq/kWh ;;
;• About €5.9 billion invested in renewables in 2023. ;;
;• New consolidated renewables capacity installed equal to 4 GW in 2023, bringing total consolidated capacity to 55.5 GW in 2023. ;;
;• Increase in consolidated renewables generation equal to 13% on 2022, representing 61% of total consolidated generation in 2023. ;;
;• Reduction of thermal capacity by about 5.1 GW on 2022, including the closure of two coal-fired plants (for a total of about 2 GW) and the sale of gas plants in Argentina (for a total of about 3 GW) and Colombia (for a total of about 0.2 GW). ;;
;• Reduction of thermal generation by 38% on 2022 (specifically, with a 45% reduction in coal-fired generation), representing 27% of total generation in 2023.;;
