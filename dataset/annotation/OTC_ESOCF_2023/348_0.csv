Primary drivers and actions;Encourage customers (especially residential customers) to switch from gas to electricity by promoting efficient electricity technologies (eg, heat pumps for home heating or induction cooktops in kitchens), increasing annual unit electricity consumption of free-market B2C power customers (in Italy and Iberia) from 2.65 MWh in 2023 to about 2.9 MWh in 2026, thereby increasing the electrification rate of customers.;Encourage customers (especially residential customers) to switch from gas to electricity by promoting efficient electricity technologies (eg, heat pumps for home heating or induction cooktops in kitchens), increasing annual unit electricity consumption of free-market B2C power customers (in Italy and Iberia) to about 3.5 MWh in 2030, thereby increasing the electrification rate of customers.;By 2040, achieve 100% of energy sales covered by renewables.
;Allocate 32% of investment in grids in 2024-2026 to connections, partly with a view to enabling the expansion of distributed generation, thereby promoting the electrification of end users energy consumption. The number of connections to distributed generation is forecast to double in the period, reaching 4 million in 2026.;Continue to invest in distribution grids, supporting the growth of distributed generation, thereby promoting the electrification of end users energy consumption, reaching 6 million connections to distributed generation in 2030;Exit retail gas sales business by 2040
;Reduce the volumes of gas sold to customers to around 8.4 billion cubic meters in 2026;Optimize the customer gas portfolio (industrial customers in particular) continuing to reduce the volume of gas sold to about 5.3 billion cubic meters in 2030;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target.
;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target;No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target;
Results and main actions in 2023;KPI achievement in 2023: 16.8 MtCO2eq;;
;6.2 million gas customers in 2023, down 6% on 2022;;
;Gas sales in 2023 equal to 8.3 billion cubic meters, down 19% on 2022.;;
;3.6 million new connections in 2023;;
