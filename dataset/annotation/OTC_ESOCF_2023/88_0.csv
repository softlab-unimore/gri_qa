Primary drivers and actions;• Invest a total of €18.6 billion in grids over the 2024-2026 period, of which 50% to improve grid resilience, quality and related greenhouse gas emissions. Replace existing distribution grid infrastructure components with SF₆-free solutions.;• Promote grid digitalization and replace existing distribution grid infrastructure components with SF₆ -free solutions.
;• Implement a circular procurement approach.  increase the number of contracts that include the measurement of the carbon footprint of the products and services purchased by Enel, encouraging its reduction in a collaborative decarbonization process with our suppliers. Strengthen dialogue with raw material producers and other utilities to define shared and effective long-term decarbonization strategies.;• Implement a circular procurement approach.  increase the number of contracts that include the measurement of the carbon footprint of the products and services purchased by Enel, encouraging its reduction in a collaborative decarbonization process with our suppliers. Strengthen dialogue with raw material producers and other utilities to define shared and effective long-term decarbonization strategies.
;• Phase out coal-fired generation by 2027 mitigating all GHG emissions related to coal supply.;• Eliminate emissions connected with gas extraction activities as the Group has fully exited gas-fired generation and sale of gas to end users.
;• No use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target;• Neutralize the residual amount through carbon-removal actions (purchase of certificates linked to nature-based or technology-based projects in voluntary carbon markets, in accordance with international standards) if complete mitigation of emissions is not feasible due to exogenous factors (technological, market or regulatory).
Results and main actions in 2023;KPI achievement in 2023: 11.9 MtCO₂ (for 2017-2030 target scope) and 13.5 MtCO₂ (for 2017-2040 target scope);
;€5.4 billion invested in the grid in 2023;
;43% reduction in coal burned in thermal generation plants.;
;41% reduction in volume of gas burned in thermal generation plants compared with 2022 (due also to the sale of gas plants in Russia and Argentina), and 19% reduction in volume of gas sold to end users compared with 2022.;
;8% reduction in electricity consumption in Group generation plants and buildings;
;24% reduction in emissions intensity (tCO₂/€mn) in supply chain in 2023 compared with 2022, reaching 684 tCO₂/€mn;
