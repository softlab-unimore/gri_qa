""EU ETS”®)"";The scheme, which applies in all EU countries, sets an annual cap on emissions that is being progressively reduced to bring down the total emissions in Europe. The fourth trading period (2021-2030) has been tightened up as part of the EU's contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement. At the annual cap correspond a specific number of allowances (for each authorized industrial plant) that are granted, through participation in auctions or for free, by the competent local authority, freely transferable and traded between operators. The obliged companies shall surrender several allowances equivalent to their polluting emissions for each reporting period.;Mandatory by law “cap and trade"" scheme. Within the Group, CO, allowances are applicable to the thermal power generation companies operating in Italy and Spain __In those countries in which the Group is engaged in thermal power generation activity, European regulations have required that EU Allowances (EUAs) are assigned via auction, and they are not granted for free.
""Ener OY efficiency certificates"";The scheme has the objective to reduce the energy consumption by end-users through various measures developed in application of European Union Directives and by national laws. These marketable certificates are issued, over a period of several years, by the competent local authorities to companies that carry out directly or indirectly initiatives/projects to improve energy efficiency. At the end of the period, obliged companies are required to present certificates corresponding to their obligatory energy savings.;Mandatory by law. The Group currently holds energy efficiency certificates in Italy and Spain where the obliged companies are, respectively, electricity distribution and sale companies.
""Guarantees of origin (GoOs)"";This European scheme has the objective to encourage use of energy produced from renewable sources. These certificates are issued by the competent local authorities to renewable generation plants that meet specific standards. They are marketable and traded, also separately from the electricity to which they refer, during their term of validity until they are cancelled by the issuer at the request of the user of the certificates.;This mechanism currently affects the Group Italian and Spanish sale companies that have an obligation to surrender a certain volume of GoOs depending on the level of sales to customers.
""Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)"";These certificates are granted in countries outside Europe to renewable energy generation companies to prove that consumed electricity has been generated in a renewable way. The functioning of this scheme is analogous to European GoOs.;This mechanism is voluntary and currently affects some Group companies in North and Latin America."
