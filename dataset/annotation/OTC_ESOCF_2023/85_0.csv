primary drivers and actions; gradual phase out of coal-fired capacity in 2024-2026, with planned closure of the federico ii and torrevaldaliga nord plants in italy (with a total capacity of about 3.6 gw).  invest EUR 12.1 billion to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 13.4 gw of new renewables capacity (about 11.3 gw of which at the consolidated level) in 2024-2026, reaching 73 gw of renewables capacity (including bess) by 2026.  continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with the proportion of renewables plants in the enel asset portfolio reaching 78% in 2026, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 86% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation.  no use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target; continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with group investments raising the proportion of renewables plants in the asset portfolio to about 85% in 2030, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 90% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation; exit from coal-fired generation, which is expected to take place by 2027 globally.  no use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target

results and main actions in 2023; about EUR 5.9 billion invested in renewables in 2023.  new consolidated renewables capacity installed equal to 4 gw in 2023, bringing total consolidated capacity to 55.5 gw in 2023.  increase in consolidated renewables generation equal to 13% on 2022, representing 61% of total consolidated generation in 2023.  reduction of thermal capacity by about 5.1 gw on 2022, including the closure of two coal-fired plants (for a total of about 2 gw) and the sale of gas plants in argentina (for a total of about 3 gw) and colombia (for a total of about 0.2 gw).  reduction of thermal generation by 38% on 2022 (specifically, with a 45% reduction in coal-fired generation), representing 27% of total generation in 2023.;;
