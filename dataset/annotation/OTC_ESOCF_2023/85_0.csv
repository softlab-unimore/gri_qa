primary drivers and actions; gradual phase out of coal-fired capacity in 2024-2026, with planned closure of the federico ii and torrevaldaliga nord plants in italy (with a total capacity of about 3.6 gw).  invest €12.1 billion to accelerate the development of renewable energy by installing 13.4 gw of new renewables capacity (about 11.3 gw of which at the consolidated level) in 2024-2026, reaching 73 gw of renewables capacity (including bess) by 2026.  continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with the proportion of renewables plants in the enel asset portfolio reaching 78% in 2026, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 86% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation.  no use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target; continue the process of decarbonizing electricity generation, with group investments raising the proportion of renewables plants in the asset portfolio to about 85% in 2030, with zero-emissions generation amounting to 90% of the total, including consolidated and managed generation; exit from coal-fired generation, which is expected to take place by 2027 globally.  no use of carbon-removal technologies to achieve the target

results and main actions in 2023; about €5.9 billion invested in renewables in 2023.  new consolidated renewables capacity installed equal to 4 gw in 2023, bringing total consolidated capacity to 55.5 gw in 2023.  increase in consolidated renewables generation equal to 13% on 2022, representing 61% of total consolidated generation in 2023.  reduction of thermal capacity by about 5.1 gw on 2022, including the closure of two coal-fired plants (for a total of about 2 gw) and the sale of gas plants in argentina (for a total of about 3 gw) and colombia (for a total of about 0.2 gw).  reduction of thermal generation by 38% on 2022 (specifically, with a 45% reduction in coal-fired generation), representing 27% of total generation in 2023.;;
