Energy management;;;;
EM-CM-130a.1;;;;
Total energy consumed (terajoules);363226;347068;329775;Total energy consumed includes the business lines cement and aggregates. Definitions and consolidation for the business line cement are in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). Volumes for Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) are below the materiality threshold and thus not included. Definition of renewables corresponds to the GCCA definition for biomass.
