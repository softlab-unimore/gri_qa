Percentage of products that qualify for credits in sustainable building design and construction certifications;0;0;0;Quantitative data not yet reported. Our products qualify for credits in sustainable building design and construction certifications in different ways. Credits in sustainable construction schemes such as LEED, DGNB and BREEAM can be achieved by products (cement, concrete, and aggregates) having an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). We have such EPDs for selected products in many of our core markets such as Sweden, Germany, Italy, or the United States. Moreover, concrete certified according to a Responsible Sourcing Scheme such as BES 6001 or the Concrete Sustainability Council (CSC) may also be used for recognised credits. Such products are on offer in the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, the United States, Poland, Sweden, and Lithuania. Given the wide range of our product portfolio, we are currently not able to quantify the exact percentage of the eligible products. At the same time, we see sustainable products as a core strategic focus and aim to achieve a share of 50 % of our Group revenue coming from sustainable products. Across our business lines, we currently achieve 35 % of our revenue from sustainable products. Pages 52, 56-58, 123-124
