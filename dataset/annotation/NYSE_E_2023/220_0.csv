"kpi;methodology
Industrial relations;Regarding industrial relations, the minimum notice period for operational changes is in line with the provisions of the laws in force and the trade union agreements signed in the Countries in which Eni operates. Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements: those employees whose employment relationship is governed by collective contracts or agreements, whether national, category, company or site. This is the only KPI dedicated to people considering role-based employees (a company with which the employee enters the employment contract). All others, including indicators on training, are calculated according to the utilisation method (company where the work is actually done). It should be noted that, using this second method, the two aspects (role companies and service) may coincide.
Remuneration;Gender Pay Ratio: the Gender Pay Ratio is calculated as the ratio of the female population's average remuneration to the male population’s average remuneration for the individual professional category and the overall population. Change in CEO/DG and employee median remuneration: year-on-year percentage change in total remuneration of the CEO/DG and the median Italian and foreign employee. The significant operational location is Italy, which is the headquarters and employs more than two-thirds of the employees.
Parental leave;The parental leave re-entry rate is calculated through the ratio of persons who returned from parental leave after taking it to the number of persons who took parental leave in 2023.
Training hours;Hours used by Eni SpA and subsidiaries employees in training courses managed and carried out by Eni Corporate University (classroom and remote) and in activities carried out by the organisational units of Eni’s Business areas/ Companies independently, also through on-the-job training. Average training hours are calculated as total training hours divided by the average number of employees in the year.
Local senior and middle Managers Abroad;Number of local senior managers + middle managers (employees born in the Country in which their main working activity is based) divided by total employment abroad.
Turnover rate;Ratio of the number of recruitments + terminations of permanent contracts to permanent employment in the previous year.
Diversity in the supervisory bodies;Regarding “Presence of women on the management bodies of Eni subsidiaries” and “Presence of women on the management bodies of Eni supervisory bodies”: abroad, only the companies with a supervisory body similar to the Board of Statutory Auditors according to the Italian law were considered.
Safety;Eni uses a large number of contractors to carry out activities at its sites. TRIR: total recordable injury rate (injuries leading to days of absence, medical treatments and cases of work limitations). Numerator: total number of recordable injuries; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of ratio multiplied by 1,000,000. High-consequence work-related injuries rate: work-related injuries with days of absence exceeding 180 days or resulting in total or permanent disability. Numerator: number of work-related injuries with serious consequences; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of ratio multiplied by 1,000,000. The value shown is the best estimate available at the date of publication of the NFI for the current year. Near miss: an incidental event, the origin, execution and potential effect of which is accidental in nature, but which is however different from an accident only in that the result has not proved damaging, due to luck or favourable circumstances, or to the mitigating intervention of technical and/or organisational protection systems. Incidental events that do not turn into accidents or injuries are considered near misses. For the assessment of injury KPls, in addition to the GRI standard, Eni adopts and integrates, through its internal procedures, the IOGP guidelines on work-relatedness events, considering country risk. Process safety incident: loss of primary containment (unplanned or uncontrolled release of any material, including non-toxic and flammable materials) from a “process”. Process safety incidents are classified as a function of the (more serious), (less serious)."
