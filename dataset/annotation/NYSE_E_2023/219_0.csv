"Emission intensity;Indicators include direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) derived from Eni-operated assets, including CO2, CH4 and N2O and are accounted for on a 100% basis. + Upstream: indicator focused on emissions associated to development and production of hydrocarbons. The denominator refers to the gross operated production of hydrocarbons. R&amp;M: indicator focused on emissions related to traditional and biorefineries. Denominator refers to refinery throughputs (raw and semi-finished materials) Enipower: indicator focused on electricity and steam production emissions from thermoelectric power plants. The denominator refers to equivalent electricity produced (excluding the Bolgiano cogeneration plant). Upstream methane emissions intensity: calculated as the ratio between direct methane emissions expressed in CH4 m3 and the natural gas production sold by assets operated upstream.
Operational efficiency;The indicator measures the emission intensity (Scope 1 and 2) per unit of energy production (expressed in kboe), monitoring the efficiency degree in a decarbonization context. The indicator refers to the main industrial assets operated by Eni compared to production (converted to barrel of oil equivalent using Eni’s average conversion factors). In particular, the following specifications apply: + Upstream: includes the hydrocarbon production and electricity plants; + R&amp;M: includes only refineries; + Chemicals: includes all plants; + Enipower: includes thermoelectric plants except for the Bolgiano cogeneration plant. Unlike the other emission intensity indices that refer to individual business areas and consider only GHG Scope 1 emissions, the Carbon Efficiency Index summarily measures Eni’s commitment to reducing GHG emission intensity, including Scope 2 emissions.
Energy intensity;The refining energy intensity index represents the total amount of energy actually used in the reference year among the various refinery processing plants, divided by the corresponding value of preset standard consumption values for each processing plant. To allow comparison over the years, 2009 data is taken as a reference (100%). For other sectors, the index represents the ratio between significant energy consumption associated to operated plants and the related production.
Net Carbon Footprint;Eni Net Carbon Footprint: the indicator considers Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from activities operated by Eni or third parties, accounted for on an equity basis. The result is net using high-quality carbon credits, mainly obtained from Natural Climate Solutions (NCS). Net Carbon Footprint Upstream: the indicator considers Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from all upstream assets Eni and third parties operate. The result is net using high quality carbon credits, mainly obtained from NCS.
Net GHG lifecycle emissions;The indicator refers to absolute Scope 1+2+3 GHG emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis. The result is net using high-quality carbon credits, mainly obtained from Natural Climate Solutions (NCS). Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 end-use emissions associated to gas purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.
Net GHG emissions;The indicator is calculated per international and industry standards (GHG Protocol and IPIECA) and includes all group Scope 1+2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions from the use of products sold (cat. 11) calculated as an equity share of upstream production. This indicator differs from Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions, which, instead, considers all Scope 1+2+3 emissions of energy products sold by Eni according to a lifecycle approach and is applied to an extended boundary that also includes products generated by third parties (e.g. natural gas produced by third parties and sold by Eni)."
