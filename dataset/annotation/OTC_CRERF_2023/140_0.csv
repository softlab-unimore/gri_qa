Measures for assessing risks of environmental damage;;
At Carrefour;;
Reporting;Quarterly reporting is carried out to assess the impact of the Group's sites in terms of the climate (emissions linked to refrigerants, energy consumption) and waste (monitoring of markdowns that may generate food waste, the waste recovery rate, etc.). Audits are performed annually by an independent third party to verify the true and fair nature of the consolidated Group data.;Quarterly
Regular impact and dependency assessments;In 2022, the Group launched the SBTN Corporate Engagement Programme, which enabled it to perform initial mapping of its biodiversity impacts and dependencies, based on its activities. The mapping exercise helped to hone in on certain commodities that have a greater impact on biodiversity than others. It should eventually serve as a basis for drafting an action plan based on science-based targets. Going forward, biodiversity impacts and dependencies will be assessed on a regular basis.;-
Certifications;In Europe, Carrefour Belgium, Carrefour France and Carrefour Italy hold ISO 50001 certification for their integrated stores (hypermarkets and supermarkets) as well as for their head offices and warehouses.

Textile supplier audits;Clean Water Project: a global programme set up to reduce the environmental impact of Carrefour supplier factories.

It is designed by Carrefour Global Sourcingâ€™s sustainable development teams and seeks to raise awareness, train and audit suppliers in the management and efficiency of water and chemical consuming processes. The Clean Water Project includes in particular a training and audit programme in chemical management, an environmental programme in China in collaboration with the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE) and a tannery certification programme.;Annual
;The Project includes a training and audit programme in chemical management, an environmental programme in China in collaboration with the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE) and a tannery certification programme. It has already been carried out in India and Bangladesh, with support from chemical audits, and in China with support from the IPE.; 
;In Bangladesh and India, Carrefour Global Sourcing has issued the Carrefour Chemical Guidebook, which sets out guidelines for purchasing, storing, using and disposing of chemicals in factories. Compliance is encouraged with training and annual unannounced inspections of treatment plant water quality, chemicals management and the proper application of the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) standard. Suppliers are monitored on the basis of a third-party chemical audit covering chemicals management, chemicals handling, wastewater treatment, sediment management and efficient water use management.
