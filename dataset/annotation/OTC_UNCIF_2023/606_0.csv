"STRATEGIES, PROCESSES AND GOALS;The initiatives are a part of the Group's strategies, one of the objectives of which is to finance, at competitive rates (and in large amounts), the development of medium and long-term through the disposal of existing ""Performing"" and ""Non-Performing"" loan portfolios and also creating eligible securities for refinancing operations with the ECB and/or with third parties (counterbalancing capacity). The main advantages of the transactions can be summarised as follows - Risk Weighted Exposure Amounts optimitation and ROAC improving; - improvement in the matching of asset maturities; - diversification of sources of financing; - broadening of investor base and resulting optimisation of funding cost; - creating counterbalancing capacity. Moreover, securitisation transactions can also be implemented for purposes related to business projects (for better management of assets), corporate restructuring or deleveraging projects.
INTERNAL MEASUREMENT AND RISK MONITORING SYSTEMS;UniCredit S.p.A. acts as ""Servicer"" for almost all transactions concerned for which is Originator. As per the agreements entered into with issuing companies (special purpose vehicles - SPV), servicing consists of performing, on behalf of these companies, administrative, collection and securitised loan collection activities as well as the management of any recovery procedures for impaired loans. Thus, as Servicer, UniCredit S.p.A. is charged with continually tracking cash flows from securitised loans and constantly monitoring their collection, with the assistance of third party companies (especially for the recovery of impaired loans; the company involved is DoValue S.p.A., which operates as an assistant to the Servicer, governed by a special agreement).
;The Servicer provides the Special Purpose Vehicle (and other counterparties indicated in the servicing agreements) information on the activity performed by, periodically reports that indicate, among other things, the collection and transfer of the income stream sold, the amount of default positions and recoveries completed, overdue installments, etc., with all information broken down in relation to specific transactions. These reports (which are usually quarterly) are periodically checked (if contractually required) by an auditing firm
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM FOR REPORTING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT;From a strategic point of view, Finance Italy is responsible for central coordination. In this context, the above structure plays: a) in the launch phase of the operation the role of proposer and provides support to the other Bank’s Divisions and to the individual Legal Entities in conducting transactions, cooperating with all the other departments (Planning &amp; Control Italy, Group Risk Management, Group M&amp;A and Corporate Development ecc) in identifying the characteristics and the distinctive features of ""true sale"" securitisations loans in order to achieve the targets set in the Group’s Funding Plan and in the Contingency Funding Plan, approved by the Board of Directors, in the ordinary plan of creating counterbalancing capacity, as well as in organisational strategy and business of Top Management. Specific transactions are subject to prior approval by the competent departments of the Holding and of the Originator Bank (during approval, among other things, the structure, costs and impacts in terms of liquidity, counterbalancing capacity, organisational, business and/or any capital relief are discussed and analysed), and to final approval by the Board of Directors of the Originator Bank; b) in the management phase of the operation, the monitoring role of the securitised portfolios performances and any rating action published by Ratings Agencies, the interactions with the Ratings Agencies in order to submit regular information on portfolios and, more generally, the role of coordination of the Originator Bank to facilitate the solution of events relating to the securitised portfolios (management of actions of payments holidays, downgrading, restructurings, etc.).
;The Bank has established a special coordination unit (General Ledger &amp; Securitisation Reporting) within the Accounting Italy Department. This unit has been tasked with administrative activities connected to the Servicer and Account Bank related-duties, and to carry out these duties, it works in close cooperation with specific, qualified areas of the Bank (Group Risk Management, Finance Italy, ecc.) and the Group. It also provides a technical and operational support to network units. The information regarding the monitoring of collections and the performance of the securitised portfolio is periodically submitted to the Servicer's Board of Directors.
HEDGING POLICIES;By agreement, securitised portfolios can be protected from interest rate risk by means of the Special Purpose Vehicle entering into Interest Rate Swap (IRS) agreements to hedge a fixed-rate portfolio, and Basis Swaps to hedge an indexed rate portfolio. In connection with these swaps, always if required by agreements, related back-to-back swap contracts are entered into between the Swap counterparty and UniCredit S.p.A. as Originator, interfaced in some cases by UniCredit Bank GMBH (ex UniCredit Bank AG).
OPERATING RESULTS;‘At the end of December 2023, the operating results related to existing securitisation transactions essentially reflected the performance of underlying portfolios and the resulting cash flows, and obviously are affected by the amount of defaults and prepayments during the period, which, moreover, are in line with the performance seen in other assets of this kind that are not securitised. The exercise of the option to repurchase the securitized portfolios underlying operations ""Cordusio 4"", ""Arena 1"" and ""Impresa 2"" did not result in significant additional economic impacts."
