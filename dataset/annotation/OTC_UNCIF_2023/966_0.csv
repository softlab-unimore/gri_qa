"ITEM;DESCRIPTION
IRB - Internal Rating Based;Method for determining the capital needed to cover credit risk within the framework of Pillar 1 of ""Basel 2"" (refer to item). The rules are applied to the exposures of the banking portfolio. Furthermore, in the IRB methods the risk weightings of the assets are determined on the basis of the bank's own internal evaluations of the debtors (or, in some cases, of the transactions). Using systems based on internal ratings, the banks determine the weighted risk exposure. The IRB methods consist of a basic method and an advanced method, which differ in terms of the risk parameters that the bank must estimate: in the basic method, the banks use their own estimates for ""PD - Probability of Default” and the regulatory values for the other risk parameters; in the advanced method, the banks use their own estimates for ""PD - Probability of Default"", ""LGD - Loss Given Default"", ""CCF - Credit Conversion Factor"" and, where provided for, ""M - Maturity"" (refer to item). The use of IRB methods for the calculation of capital requirements is subject to authorisation from Banca d'Italia.
