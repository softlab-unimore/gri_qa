"ITEM;DESCRIPTION
ABCP Conduits - Asset Backed Commercial Paper Conduits;Asset Backed Commercial Paper Conduits are a type of “SPV - Special Purpose Vehicle” (refer to item) set up to securitise various types of assets and financed by Commercial Paper. Commercial Paper generally matures in 270 days, with payment of principal and interest depending on the cash flow generated by the underlying assets. ABCP Conduits may be single-sellers or multi-sellers according to the number of issues they make. Conduits generally require several SPVs. The first-level vehicles issue the Commercial Paper and finance one or more second-level vehicles or Purchase Companies (see item) which purchase the assets to be securitised. An ABCP Conduit will have the following: issues of short-term paper creating a maturity mismatch between the assets held and the paper issued; e liquidity lines covering the maturity mismatch; and ¢ security covering default risk in respect of both specific assets and the entire programme.
ABS - Asset Backed Securities;Debt securities, generally issued by an “SPV - Special Purpose Vehicle’ (refer to item) guaranteed by assets of various types such as mortgage loans, consumer credits, credit card receivables, etc. Principal and interest payments are subject to the performance of the securitised assets and the existence of any further security guaranteeing the bond. ABSs are divided into tranches (senior, mezzanine and junior) according to the priority with which principal and interest will be paid.
AC;Financial asset amortised at cost.
Acquisition finance;Finance for business acquisition operations. The most common form of Acquisition finance is the leveraged buy-out (refer to item ""Leveraged finance"").
Allocated capital;It represents the amount of capital absorbed by the Group and the Divisions to perform their business activities and to cover all the types of related risks. It is measured by Regulatory Capital obtained by multiplying (i) risk-weighted assets by (ii) target Common Equity tier 1 ratio, plus certain regulatory deductions (e.g. shortfall and securitisations).
ALM - Asset &amp; Liability Management;Integrated management of assets and liabilities, designed to allocate resources in such a manner as to optimise the risk/return ratio.
AMA - Advanced Measurement Approach;‘Applying this methodology the operational risk requirement is obtained with calculation models based on operational loss data and other evaluation elements collected and processed by the bank. Admittance threshold and specific suitability requirements have been provided for the use of the standardised and advanced approaches. For the AMA approach the requirements concern, beside the management system, also the measurement system.
Asset management;Activities of management of the financial investments of third parties.
Audit;Process of controlling a company's activities and accounting, carried out either by an internal body (internal audit) or by an external firm of auditors (external audit).
Back-testing;Statistical technique which entails the comparison of model estimates of risk parameters with the ex-post empirical evidences.
Bad Loans;Exposures to borrowers in a state of insolvency (even when not recognised in a court of law) or in an essentially similar situation, regardless of any loss forecasts made by the bank (e.g. irrespective of the presence of any protection covering the exposures).
Bank Levy;Charges applied at national level specifically to financial institutions, mainly based on Balance sheet figures, or parts of it.
Banking Book;Portfolio that identifies the technical forms of lending and funding typical of the core business of the bank, including consumer and residential loans, investments in securities, deposits, etc.
Basel 2;New international capital agreement redefining the guidelines for determining the minimum capital requirements for banks. Such prudential regulation, which came into force in Italy in 2008, is based on three pillars. Pillar 1 While the objective of a level of capitalization equivalent to 8% of the risk-weighted exposures remains unchanged, a new set of rules has been defined for measuring the typical risks associated with banking and financial activities (credit risk, counterparty risk, market risk and operational risk) which provides for alternative calculation methods characterised by different levels of complexity, with the ability to use internally developed models subject to prior authorization by the Regulatory Authority; Pillar 2 This requires the banks to have processes and tools for determining the adequate level of total internal capital (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process - ICAAP) for covering all types of risk, including risks other than those covered by the overall capital requirement (Pillar 1), within the framework of an evaluation of current and future exposure that takes account of strategies and of changes in the reference context. It is the Regulatory Authority's task to examine the ICAAP process, formulate an overall judgment and, where necessary, apply the appropriate corrective measures; Pillar 3 It refers to the obligations to publish information concerning capital adequacy, exposure to risks, and the general characteristics of the systems used for identifying, measuring and managing those risks."
