Let's think step-by-step.

to determine the highest average amount of waste generated in the years 2023 and 2022 among the companies otc_crerf and vivendi, we need to extract the total waste amounts for both years from each company and then calculate the average for each.

1. **otc_crerf**:
   - total waste in 2023: 671 tonnes
   - total waste in 2022: 587 tonnes
   - average waste = (671 + 587) / 2 = 629.00 tonnes

2. **vivendi**:
   - total waste in 2023: 10007 tonnes
   - total waste in 2022: 11388 tonnes
   - average waste = (10007 + 11388) / 2 = 10697.50 tonnes

now, we compare the averages:
- otc_crerf average: 629.00 tonnes
- vivendi average: 10697.50 tonnes

the highest average amount of waste generated between the two companies is from vivendi.

final answer: 10697.50
