[TATLLM END-TO-END]

Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the environmental domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context. The given question is relevant to the table and text. Generate an appropriate answer to the given question.

### Instruction
Given a table and a list of texts in the following, what is the answer to the question? Please predict the answer and store it in a variable named ‘{answer}‘. If there are multiple values, separate them using the ’#’ symbol. If the value of the ‘{answer}‘ is numerical, predict its scale and store it in a variable named ‘{scale}‘. The value of ‘{scale}‘ can be one of the following: ‘none‘, ‘percent‘, ‘thousand‘, ‘million‘, or ‘billion‘. For non-numerical values, set the value of ‘{scale}‘ to ’none’. Finally, present the final answer in the format of "The answer is: {answer} #### and its corresponding scale is: {scale}"

Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the environmental domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context. The given question is relevant to the table and text. Generate an appropriate answer to the given question.

### Instruction
Given a table and a list of texts in the following, answer the question posed using the following five-step process:
1. Step 1: Predict the type of question being asked. Store this prediction in the variable ‘{question_type}‘. The value of ‘{question_type}‘ can be one of the following:‘Single span‘, ‘Multiple spans‘, ‘Count‘, or ‘Arithmetic‘.
2. Step 2: Extract the relevant strings or numerical values from the provided table or texts. Store these pieces of evidence in the variable ‘{evidence}‘. If there are multiple pieces of evidence, separate them using the ’#’ symbol.
3. Step 3: if the ‘{question_type}‘ is ‘Arithmetic‘, formulate an equation using values stored in ‘{evidence}‘. Store this equation in the variable ‘{equation}‘. For all other question types, set the value of {equation} to ’N.A.’.
4. Step 4: Predict or calculate the answer based on the question type, evidence and equation. Store it in the variable ‘{answer}‘. If there are multiple values, separate them using the ’#’ symbol.
5. Step 5: If the value of the ‘{answer}‘ is numerical, predict its scale and store it in a variable named ‘{scale}‘. The value of ‘{scale}‘ can be one of the following: ‘none‘, ‘percent‘, ‘thousand‘, ‘million‘, or ‘billion‘. For non-numerical values, set the value of ‘{scale}‘ to ’none’.
Please organize the results in the following table:
| step | output |
| 1 | {question_type} |
| 2 | {evidence} |
| 3 | {equation} |
| 4 | {answer} |
| 5 | {scale} |
Finally, present the final answer in the format: \"The answer is: {answer} #### and its corresponding scale is: {scale}\"
